2,2,AML,"The know your customer or know your client (KYC) guidelines in financial services require that professionals make an effort to verify the identity, suitability, and risks involved with maintaining a business relationship. The procedures fit within the broader scope of a bank's anti-money laundering (AML) policy. KYC processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed customers, agents, consultants, or distributors are anti-bribery compliant, and are actually who they claim to be. Banks, insurers, export creditors, and other financial institutions are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed due diligence information. Initially, these regulations were imposed only on the financial institutions but now the non-financial industry, fintech, virtual assets dealers, and even non-profit organizations are liable to oblige.

The objectives of FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. FATF is a ""policy-making body"" that works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas. FATF monitors progress in implementing its Recommendations through ""peer reviews"" (""mutual evaluations"") of member countries.
Since 2000, FATF has maintained the FATF blacklist (formally called the ""Call for action"") and the FATF greylist (formally called the ""Other monitored jurisdictions""). The blacklist has led financial institutions to shift resources and services away from the listed.

14,14,ASIC,"An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC ) is an integrated circuit (IC) chip customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency video codec (e.g. AMD VCE) is an ASIC. Application-specific standard product (ASSP) chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000 series. ASIC chips are typically fabricated using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology, as MOS integrated circuit chips.As feature sizes have shrunk and design tools improved over the years, the maximum complexity (and hence functionality) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 logic gates to over 100 million. Modern ASICs often include entire microprocessors, memory blocks including ROM, RAM, EEPROM, flash memory and other large building blocks. Such an ASIC is often termed a SoC (system-on-chip). Designers of digital ASICs often use a hardware description language (HDL), such as Verilog or VHDL, to describe the functionality of ASICs.Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are the modern-day technology improvement on breadboards, meaning that they are not made to be application-specific as opposed to ASICs. Programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications. For smaller designs or lower production volumes, FPGAs may be more cost-effective than an ASIC design, even in production. The non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars. Therefore, device manufacturers typically prefer FPGAs for prototyping and devices with low production volume and ASICs for very large production volumes where NRE costs can be amortized across many devices.","[{'match': 'standard', 'norm': 'standard', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 310, 'end': 318}, {'match': 'standard', 'norm': 'standard', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 384, 'end': 392}]",True,Non-Financial Entity,"{'guideline': 0.2505337595939636, 'regulatory body': 0.19311730563640594, 'policy': 0.11921346187591553, 'bank': 0.0643296092748642, 'finance': 0.03640025854110718}"

The ECB Executive Board enforces the policies and decisions of the Governing Council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the TARGET2 payments system.
The ECB was established by the Treaty of Amsterdam in May 1999 with the purpose of guaranteeing and maintaining price stability. On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon became effective and the bank gained the official status of an EU institution. When the ECB was created, it covered a Eurozone of eleven members.

The current President of the ECB is Christine Lagarde. Headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, the bank formerly occupied the Eurotower prior to the construction of its new seat.
The ECB is directly governed by European Union law. Its capital stock, worth €11 billion, is owned by all 27 central banks of the EU member states as shareholders. The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the capital key has been readjusted since.

Before its latest promotion to the Liga I in 2004, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. CFR Cluj has since relied increasingly on foreign players for its success, and in the 2005–06 season participated in its first European competition, the Intertoto Cup, where it finished as runner-up. With significant financial support from previous owner Árpád Pászkány, CFR took the national title away from capital-based teams after seventeen years and became national champion for the first time in the 2007–08 campaign.Between 2017 and 2022, ""the White and Burgundies"" won five successive championships. In total, CFR has amassed sixteen domestic trophies, all of them in the 21st century—eight Liga I, four Cupa României, and four Supercupa României. As well as becoming an esteemed figure in Romanian football, the team has secured three qualifications each to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League group stages, and one qualification to the Europa Conference League group stage. 
CFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring Universitatea Cluj, with matches between the two being known as Derbiul Clujului. Several, but minor rivalries also developed in the recent period against teams with which CFR contended for the league title.

ABS-CBN's production and post-production facility is located at the Horizon IT Park in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan which opened in 2018. ABS-CBN was colloquially referred to as the Kapamilya Network; the branding was originally introduced in 1999 and was officially introduced in 2003 during the celebration of its 50th anniversary and was used until its May 5, 2020 shutdown when ABS-CBN's branding changed to Kapamilya Forever in support for the network's franchise renewal on May 13, 2020.

The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. U.S. banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, popularly called greenbacks due to their predominantly green color.
The monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System, which acts as the nation's central bank.
The U.S. dollar was originally defined under a bimetallic standard of 371.25 grains (24.057 g) (0.7735 troy ounces) fine silver or, from 1837, 23.22 grains (1.505 g) fine gold, or $20.67 per troy ounce. The Gold Standard Act of 1900 linked the dollar solely to gold. From 1934, its equivalence to gold was revised to $35 per troy ounce. Since 1971 all links to gold have been repealed.The U.S. dollar became an important international reserve currency after the First World War, and displaced the pound sterling as the world's primary reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement towards the end of the Second World War. The dollar is the most widely used currency in international transactions, and a free-floating currency. It is also the official currency in several countries and the de facto currency in many others, with Federal Reserve Notes (and, in a few cases, U.S. coins) used in circulation.
As of February 10, 2021, currency in circulation amounted to US$2.10 trillion, $2.05 trillion of which is in Federal Reserve Notes (the remaining $50 billion is in the form of coins and older-style United States Notes).","[{'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 738, 'end': 742}, {'match': 'standard', 'norm': 'standard', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 802, 'end': 810}]",True,regulatory body,"{'regulatory body': 0.8783127069473267, 'bank': 0.8400428295135498, 'policy': 0.8389561176300049, 'guideline': 0.32190224528312683}"

The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.  Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.
The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016 and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it is directly binding and applicable, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.
The regulation became a model for many other laws across the world, including in Turkey, Mauritius, Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Kenya. As of 2021 the United Kingdom retains the law in identical form despite no longer being an EU member state.

104,104,ICO,"An initial coin offering (ICO) or initial currency offering is a type of funding using cryptocurrencies.

In an ICO, a quantity of cryptocurrency is sold in the form of ""tokens"" (""coins"") to speculators or investors, in exchange for legal tender or other (generally established and more stable) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. The tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency if or when the ICO's funding goal is met and the project successfully launches.
An ICO can be a source of capital for startup companies. ICOs can allow startups to avoid regulations that prevent them from seeking investment directly from the public, and intermediaries such as venture capitalists, banks, and stock exchanges, which may demand greater scrutiny and some percentage of future profits or joint ownership. ICOs may fall outside existing regulations, depending on the nature of the project, or be banned altogether in some jurisdictions, such as China and South Korea.
Due to the lack of regulation and enforcement of securities law, ICOs have been the vehicle for scams and fraud. Fewer than half of all ICOs survive four months after the offering, while almost half of ICOs sold in 2017 failed by February 2018.

BSA is part of the international Scout Movement and became a founding member organization of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922.
The stated mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to ""prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law."" Youth are trained in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness, good citizenship, and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking. To further these outdoor activities, the BSA has four high-adventure bases: Northern Tier (Minnesota, Manitoba, and Ontario), Philmont Scout Ranch (New Mexico), Sea Base (Florida, US Virgin Islands, and Bahamas), and Summit Bechtel Reserve (West Virginia), as well as nearly one hundred separate camps and reservations specifically dedicated to scouts.
The main Scouting divisions are Cub Scouting for ages 5 to 11 years, Scouts BSA for ages 10 to 18, Venturing for ages 14 through 21, and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21. The BSA operates Scouting by chartering local organizations, such as churches, clubs, civic associations, or educational organization, to implement the Scouting program for youth within their communities. Units are led entirely by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization, who are supported by local councils using both paid professional Scouters and volunteers. Additionally, Learning for Life is an affiliate that provides in-school and career education.
On February 1, 2019, the Boy Scouts of America renamed its flagship program, Boy Scouts, to Scouts BSA to reflect its policy change allowing girls to join separate, gender-specific troops. Shortly thereafter, the largest charter organization supporting BSA, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, decided to part ways substantially contributing to a net loss of nearly a million scouts/leaders.

158,158,CRR,"Monetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country, generally  central bank, controls the supply of money in the economy by its control over interest rates in order to maintain price stability and achieve high economic growth. In India, the central monetary authority is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
It is designed to maintain the price stability in the economy. Other objectives of the monetary policy of India, as stated by RBI, are:

Price stability
Price stability implies promoting economic development with considerable emphasis on price stability. The centre of focus is to facilitate the environment which is favourable to the architecture that enables the developmental projects to run swiftly while also maintaining reasonable price stability.Controlled expansion of bank credit
One of the important functions of RBI is the controlled expansion of bank credit and money supply with special attention to seasonal requirement for credit without affecting the output.Promotion of fixed investment
The aim here is to increase the productivity of investment by restraining non essential fixed investment.Restriction of inventories and stocks
Overfilling of stocks and products becoming outdated due to excess of stock often results in sickness of the unit. To avoid this problem, the central monetary authority carries out this essential function of restricting the inventories. The main objective of this policy is to avoid over-stocking and idle money in the organisation.Promoting efficiency
It tries to increase the efficiency in the financial system and tries to incorporate structural changes such as deregulating interest rates, easing operational constraints in the credit delivery system, introducing new money market instruments, etc.Reducing rigidity
RBI tries to bring about flexibilities in operations which provide a considerable autonomy. It encourages more competitive environment and diversification. It maintains its control over financial system whenever and wherever necessary to maintain the discipline and prudence in operations of the financial system.","[{'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 96, 'end': 100}, {'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 125, 'end': 130}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 806, 'end': 810}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 887, 'end': 891}, {'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 903, 'end': 908}, {'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1482, 'end': 1487}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1572, 'end': 1581}, {'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1748, 'end': 1753}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1982, 'end': 1991}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2092, 'end': 2101}]",True,policy,"{'policy': 0.9408607482910156, 'regulatory body': 0.7110056281089783, 'bank': 0.7097941040992737, 'guideline': 0.5101566910743713}"

It was structured as a company limited by guarantee and was funded entirely by fees charged to the financial services industry.Due to perceived regulatory failure of the banks during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the UK government decided to restructure financial regulation and abolish the FSA. On 19 December 2012, the Financial Services Act 2012 received royal assent, abolishing the FSA with effect from 1 April 2013. Its responsibilities were then split between two new agencies: the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England.
Until its abolition, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell was the FSA's chairman and Hector Sants was CEO until the end of June 2012, having announced his resignation on 16 March 2012.Its main office was in Canary Wharf, London, with another office in Edinburgh.

In Australia, a proprietary company is defined under section 45A(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).The Act puts certain restrictions on proprietary companies such as not permitting them to have more than 50 members (shareholders). Another important restriction relates to fundraising.  A proprietary company must not engage in fundraising that would require a disclosure document such as a prospectus, an offer information statement, or a profile statement to be issued (sec.113(3)).  The Act states in which circumstances a company must issue a prospectus when attempting to raise funds.  This means that a proprietary company must not offer its shares to the public.
Section 45A of the Act also distinguishes proprietary companies as either ""large proprietary"" or ""small proprietary"".  The differences here relate to issues such as operating revenue, consolidated gross assets, and the number of employed persons.
Large proprietary companies are required to appoint an auditor and lodge appropriate financial statements with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).","[{'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1299, 'end': 1308}]",True,regulatory body,"{'regulatory body': 0.6898882389068604, 'guideline': 0.36459022760391235, 'policy': 0.25910699367523193, 'bank': 0.1684844046831131}"
165,165,FMI,"The Functional Mock-up Interface (or FMI) defines a standardized interface to be used in computer simulations to develop complex cyber-physical systems.
The vision of FMI is to support this approach: if the real product is to be assembled from a wide range of parts interacting in complex ways, each controlled by a complex set of physical laws, then it should be possible to create a virtual product that can be assembled from a set of models that each represent a combination of parts, each a model of the physical laws as well as a model of the control systems (using electronics, hydraulics, and digital software) assembled digitally. The FMI standard thus provides the means for model based development of systems and is used for example for designing functions that are driven by electronic devices inside vehicles (e.g. ESP controllers, active safety systems, combustion controllers). Activities from systems modelling, simulation, validation and test can be covered with the FMI based approach. 
To create the FMI standard, a large number of software companies and research centers have worked in a cooperation project established through a European consortium  that has been conducted by Dassault Systèmes under the name of MODELISAR. The MODELISAR project started in 2008 to define the FMI specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through use cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products. The development of the FMI specifications was coordinated by Daimler AG. After the end of the MODELISAR project in 2011, FMI is managed and developed as a Modelica Association Project (MAP).
The four required FMI aspects of creating models capable of being assembled have been covered in Modelisar project: 

FMI for model exchange,
FMI for co-simulation,
FMI for applications,
FMI for PLM (integration of models and related data in product life-cycle management).In practice, the FMI implementation by a software modelling tool enables the creation of a simulation model that can be interconnected or the creation of a software library called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).

The thermal protection was damaged at the same time as the orbit change. Subsequent investigation assessed the Meteosat-8 spinning spacecraft's orbit change due to the mass release of thermal covering whose attachment failed.

242,242,DNFBP,"Money laundering is the process of concealing the origin of money, often obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, embezzlement or gambling, by converting it into a legitimate source. It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime.
In US law, money laundering is the practice of engaging in financial transactions to conceal the identity, source, or destination of illegally gained money. In UK law the common law definition is wider. The act is defined as ""taking any action with property of any form which is either wholly or in part the proceeds of a crime that will disguise the fact that that property is the proceeds of a crime or obscure the beneficial ownership of said property"".
In the past, the term ""money laundering"" was applied only to financial transactions related to organized crime. Today its definition is often expanded by government and international regulators such as the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to mean ""any financial transaction which generates an asset or a value as the result of an illegal act"", which may involve actions such as tax evasion or false accounting. In the UK, it does not even need to involve money, but any economic good. Courts involve money laundering committed by private individuals, drug dealers, businesses, corrupt officials, members of criminal organizations such as the Mafia, and even states.
As financial crime has become more complex, and ""Financial Intelligence"" (FININT) has become more recognized in combating international crime and terrorism, money laundering has become more prominent in political, economic, and legal debate.

291,291,LIBOR,"The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate is an interest-rate average calculated from estimates submitted by the leading banks in London.  Each bank estimates what it would be charged were it to borrow from other banks. The resulting average rate is usually abbreviated to Libor () or LIBOR, or more officially to ICE LIBOR (for Intercontinental Exchange LIBOR). It was formerly known as BBA Libor (for British Bankers' Association Libor or the trademark bba libor) before the responsibility for the administration was transferred to Intercontinental Exchange. It is the primary benchmark, along with the Euribor, for short-term interest rates around the world. Libor was phased out at the end of 2021, and market participants are being encouraged to transition to risk-free interest rates.Libor rates are calculated for five currencies and seven borrowing periods ranging from overnight to one year and are published each business day by Thomson Reuters. Many financial institutions, mortgage lenders, and credit card agencies set their own rates relative to it. At least $350 trillion in derivatives and other financial products are tied to Libor.In June 2012, multiple criminal settlements by Barclays Bank revealed significant fraud and collusion by member banks connected to the rate submissions, leading to the Libor scandal. The British Bankers' Association said on 25 September 2012 that it would transfer oversight of Libor to UK regulators, as proposed by Financial Services Authority managing director Martin Wheatley's independent review recommendations. Wheatley's review recommended that banks submitting rates to Libor must base them on actual inter-bank deposit market transactions and keep records of those transactions, that individual banks' Libor submissions be published after three months, and recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates. Financial institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs after implementation of the recommended reforms. The UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review's recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.Significant reforms, in line with the Wheatley Review, came into effect in 2013 and a new administrator took over in early 2014. The British government regulates Libor through criminal and regulatory laws passed by Parliament. In particular, the Financial Services Act 2012 brings Libor under UK regulatory oversight and creates a criminal offence for knowingly or deliberately making false or misleading statements relating to benchmark-setting.

The platform consists of a dashboard, that provides data and insights into key indicators - measuring areas such as wellbeing, environmental quality, quality of public services and security - alongside an interactive tool Your Better Life Index (BLI), which encourages citizens to create their own indexes by ranking each of the indicators according to the importance in their own lives.
The index and tool were created as part of the OECD Better Life Initiative. This initiative began in 2011 in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, also known as the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, whose recommendations sought to address concerns that standard macroeconomic statistics like GDP failed to give a true account of people's current and future well-being. The initiative's goals are to develop social and wellbeing indicators that can better reflect growth focusing on four key areas; environmental sustainability, increased wellbeing, falling inequality and systems resilience. The 'beyond growth' approach to economic progress is relatively new and the OECD Better Life Initiative promotes the co-production of what we might standardise by facilitating conversation between the public and policymakers.
You can create your own economic index by ranking 11 areas of socio-economic progress by what is important to you, this generates a ranking so you can see how your country compares. You are encouraged to share your indicator with others on the platform to view theirs and discuss your similarities and differences. You can choose to share their data with OECD and will then be asked to provide more demographical data about your situation. The OECD Better Life Initiative then analyses all users input data and reports the findings in a bi-annual report named How's Life? Well-being. The data used in the report consists of 80+ indicators including measures on inequality and further socio-economic indicators. The findings reflect what is important to citizens, and how their current socio-economic situations reflect in the areas of governance that they prioritise. These insights are then used to guide governments to put well-being at the centre of their policymaking by shedding light on what well-being means to their citizens.  In this way, by using the tool citizens can shape public policy.","[{'match': 'standard', 'norm': 'standard', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 968, 'end': 976}]",True,Non-Financial Entity,"{'policy': 0.9271135926246643, 'guideline': 0.8940151929855347, 'regulatory body': 0.39561954140663147, 'bank': 0.3949338495731354, 'finance': 0.39033979177474976}"

Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.
Photoshop's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers. However, in October 2002 (following the introduction of Creative Suite branding), each new version of Photoshop was designated with ""CS"" plus a number; e.g., the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two different editions: Standard and Extended. With the introduction of the Creative Cloud branding in June 2013 (and in turn, the change of the ""CS"" suffix to ""CC""), Photoshop's licensing scheme was changed to that of software as a service subscription model. Historically, Photoshop was bundled with additional software such as Adobe ImageReady, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Device Central and Adobe Camera RAW.
Alongside Photoshop, Adobe also develops and publishes Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop Express,  Photoshop Fix, Photoshop Sketch and Photoshop Mix. As of November 2019, Adobe has also released a full version of Photoshop for the iPad, and while initially limited, Adobe plans to bring more features to Photoshop for iPad. Collectively, they are branded as ""The Adobe Photoshop Family"".","[{'match': 'standard', 'norm': 'standard', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 214, 'end': 222}]",True,Non-Financial Entity,"{'policy': 0.6177811026573181, 'guideline': 0.601787269115448, 'regulatory body': 0.49426132440567017, 'bank': 0.20491132140159607, 'finance': 0.1546442061662674}"

The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.  Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.
The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016 and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it is directly binding and applicable, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.
The regulation became a model for many other laws across the world, including in Turkey, Mauritius, Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Kenya. As of 2021 the United Kingdom retains the law in identical form despite no longer being an EU member state.

579,579,IRB,"An institutional review board (IRB), also known as an independent ethics committee (IEC), ethical review board (ERB), or research ethics board (REB), is a committee that applies research ethics by reviewing the methods proposed for research to ensure that they are ethical. Such boards are formally designated to approve (or reject), monitor, and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans. They often conduct some form of risk-benefit analysis in an attempt to determine whether or not research should be conducted. The purpose of the IRB is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in a research study. Along with developed countries, many developing countries have established national, regional or local Institutional Review Boards in order to safeguard ethical conduct of research concerning both national and international norms, regulations or codes.A key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to do by reviewing research protocols and related materials. The protocol review assesses the ethics of the research and its methods, promotes fully informed and voluntary participation by prospective subjects capable of making such choices (or, if that is not possible, informed permission given by a suitable proxy), and seeks to maximize the safety of subjects. While its composition varies, it often includes a balance of academia and non-academia members. This serves to provide a greater scope of understanding which helps ensure ethics in research.
IRBs are most commonly used for studies in the fields of health and the social sciences, including anthropology, sociology, and psychology. Such studies may be clinical trials of new drugs or devices, studies of personal or social behavior, opinions or attitudes, or studies of how health care is delivered and might be improved.","[{'match': 'board', 'norm': 'board', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 24, 'end': 29}, {'match': 'board', 'norm': 'board', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 105, 'end': 110}, {'match': 'board', 'norm': 'board', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 137, 'end': 142}]",True,Non-Financial Entity,"{'guideline': 0.5162561535835266, 'regulatory body': 0.4686933159828186, 'policy': 0.3444077670574188, 'bank': 0.23688091337680817, 'finance': 0.008171353489160538}"

It was previously known as Treaty Establishing the European Community (TEC).The Treaty originated as the Treaty of Rome (fully the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community), which brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and came into force on 1 January 1958. It remains one of the two most important treaties in the modern-day European Union (EU).
Its name has been amended twice since 1957. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 removed the word ""economic"" from the Treaty of Rome's official title and, in 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon renamed it the ""Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union"".
Following the 2005 referenda, which saw the failed attempt at launching a European Constitution, on 13 December 2007 the Lisbon Treaty was signed. This saw the 'TEC' renamed as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and, once again, renumbered. The Lisbon reforms resulted in the merging of the three pillars into the reformed European Union.In March 2011, the European Council adopted a decision to amend the Treaty by adding a new paragraph to Article 136.

594,594,SIFI,"A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"".As the financial crisis of 2007–2008 unfolded, the international community moved to protect the global financial system through preventing the failure of SIFIs, or, if one does fail, limiting the adverse effects of its failure. In November 2011, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published a list of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs).Also in November 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced new guidance (known as Basel III) that also specifically target SIFIs. The main focus of the Basel III guidance is to increase bank capital requirements and to introduce capital surcharges for G-SIFIs. However, some economists warned in 2012 that the tighter Basel III capital regulation, which is primarily based on risk-weighted assets, may further negatively affect the stability of the financial system.It is important to note that both the FSB and the BCBS are only policy research and development entities. They do not establish laws, regulations or rules for any financial institution directly. They merely act in an advisory or guidance capacity when it comes to non G-SIFIs. It is up to each country's specific lawmakers and regulators to enact whatever portions of the recommendations they deem appropriate for their own domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) or national SIFIs (N-SIFIs). Each country's internal financial regulators make their own determination of what is a SIFI. Once those regulators make that determination, they may set specific laws, regulations and rules that would apply to those entities.
Virtually every SIFI operates at the top level as a holding company made up of numerous subsidiaries. It is not unusual for the subsidiaries to number in the hundreds. Even though the uppermost holding company is located in the home country, where it is subject, at that level, to that home regulator, the subsidiaries may be organized and operating in several different countries. Each subsidiary is then subject to potential regulation by every country where it actually conducts business.
At present (and for the likely foreseeable future) there is no such thing as a global regulator. Likewise there is no such thing as global insolvency, global bankruptcy, or the legal requirement for a global bail out. Each legal entity is treated separately. Each country is responsible (in theory) for containing a financial crisis that starts in their country from spreading across borders. Looking up from a country prospective as to what is a SIFI may be different than when looking down on the entire globe and attempting to determine what entities are significant. The FSB hired Mark Carney to write the report that coined the term G-SIFI for this reason in 2011.

633,633,FSR,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt (;  ROH-zə-velt, -⁠vəlt; January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), often referred to by his initials FDR, was an American politician and attorney who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. As a member of the Democratic Party, he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the New Deal Coalition, which defined modern liberalism in the United States throughout the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II, which ended shortly after he died in office.
Born into the Roosevelt family in Hyde Park, New York, he graduated from both Groton School and Harvard College, and attended Columbia Law School, which he left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children, of whom five survived into adulthood. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's 1920 national ticket, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness, believed at the time to be polio, and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from his condition, Roosevelt founded a polio rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. Although unable to walk unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office after his election as governor of New York in 1928. He served as governor from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States.
In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover in one of the largest landslide victories in US history. The Roosevelt presidency began in the midst of the Great Depression and during the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. Congress, he spearheaded unprecedented federal legislative productivity. Roosevelt called for the creation of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. Within his first year, he began implementing these policies through a series of executive orders and federal legislation collectively called the New Deal. Many New Deal programs provided relief to the unemployed such as the National Recovery Administration. Several New Deal programs and federal laws such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act provided relief to farmers. Roosevelt also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor. In addition to the economy, Roosevelt also sought to curtail the rising crime fueled by Prohibition. After campaigning on a platform to repeal it, Roosevelt implemented the Beer Permit Act of 1933  and enforced the 21st amendment. Tax revenue collected from alcohol sales would go to public works as part of the New Deal. Roosevelt frequently used radio to speak directly to the American people, giving 30 ""fireside chat"" radio addresses during his presidency and became the first American president to be televised. The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1936, and Roosevelt won a landslide re-election in 1936. Despite the popularity of the New Deal, many within the US Supreme Court maintained their conservative bent and frequently struck down New Deal initiatives. Following his re-election, Roosevelt sought to counter this by lobbying for the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (or ""court packing plan""), which would have expanded the size of the Supreme Court. The bill was blocked by the newly formed bipartisan Conservative Coalition, which also sought to prevent further New Deal legislation; as a result, the economy began to decline, which led to the recession of 1937–1938. Other major 1930s legislation and agencies implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Social Security, and the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940 for his third term, making him the only U.S. president to serve for more than two terms. By 1939 another World War was on the horizon which prompted the United States to respond by passing a series of laws affirming neutrality and rejecting intervention. Despite this, President Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China, the United Kingdom, and eventually the Soviet Union. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, an event he called ""a date which will live in infamy"", Roosevelt obtained a congressional declaration of war against Japan. On December 11 Japan's allies, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States. In response, the US formally joined the Allies and entered the European theater of war. Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy, initiating the Lend-Lease program and making the defeat of Germany first a priority over that of Japan. His administration oversaw the construction of The Pentagon, initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb, and worked with other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. It was under his wartime leadership that the United States became a superpower on the world stage.
Roosevelt won re-election in the 1944 presidential election on his post-war recovery platform. His physical health began declining during the later war years, and less than three months into his fourth term, Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Vice President Harry S. Truman assumed office as president and oversaw the acceptance of surrender by the Axis powers. Since his death, several of Roosevelt's actions have come under substantial criticism, such as the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Nevertheless, he is consistently ranked by scholars, political scientists, and historians as one of the greatest presidents in American history.","[{'match': 'finance', 'norm': 'finance', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2881, 'end': 2888}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 4709, 'end': 4718}]",True,regulatory body,"{'regulatory body': 0.5866010785102844, 'policy': 0.5595048069953918, 'guideline': 0.5262494087219238, 'bank': 0.4028628170490265}"
662,662,CBG,"A brigade is a major tactical military formation  that typically comprises three to six battalions plus supporting elements. It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. Two or more brigades may constitute a division.
Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades). In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units. Historically, such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups. On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task.
Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic. Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure. The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 3,200 to 5,500 troops. However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could go as high as 11,000 troops. The Soviet Union, its forerunners and successors, mostly use ""regiment"" instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II.
A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel. In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer. The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff. The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff. Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major’ and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff. Some brigades may also have a deputy commander. The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade. On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached. The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit.

In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit.","[{'match': 'standard', 'norm': 'standard', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1021, 'end': 1029}]",True,Non-Financial Entity,"{'regulatory body': 0.35945919156074524, 'bank': 0.16970108449459076, 'finance': 0.1091156154870987, 'guideline': 0.09129562973976135, 'policy': 0.049690041691064835}"
663,663,ABN,"ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is a Dutch bank with headquarters in Amsterdam. ABN AMRO Bank is the third-largest bank in the Netherlands. It was re-established in its current form in 2009, following the acquisition and break-up of the original ABN AMRO by a banking consortium consisting of Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Santander Group and Fortis. Following the collapse of Fortis, who acquired the Dutch business, it was nationalized by the Dutch government along with Fortis Bank Nederland. It was relisted as a public company again in 2015.
The bank is a product of a long history of mergers and acquisitions that date to 1765. In 1991, Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) and AMRO Bank (itself the result of a merger of the Amsterdamsche Bank and the Rotterdamsche Bank in the 1960s) agreed to merge to create the original ABN AMRO.
In July 2006, Favonius Ventures, which was founded and headed by Roel Pieper, received all of the technology investments of ABN AMRO Capital which is the private equity business unit of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.By 2007, ABN AMRO was the second-largest bank in the Netherlands and the eighth-largest in Europe by assets. At that time the magazine The Banker and Fortune Global 500 placed it 15th in the list of world's biggest banks and it had operations in 63 countries, with over 110,000 employees.
In October 2007, a consortium of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander, known as RFS Holdings B.V. acquired the bank, in what was the world's biggest bank takeover to date. Consequently, the bank was divided into three parts, each owned by one of the members of the consortium. However, RBS and Fortis soon ran into serious trouble: the large debt created to fund the takeover had depleted the banks' reserves just as the financial crisis of 2007–2010 started. As a result, the Dutch government stepped in and bailed out Fortis in October 2008, before splitting ABN AMRO's Dutch assets (which had primarily been allocated to Fortis) from those owned by RBS, which were effectively assumed by the UK government due to its bail-out of the British bank. The operations owned by Santander, notably those in Italy and Brazil, were merged with Santander, sold or eliminated.
The Dutch government appointed former Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm as CEO to restructure and stabilise the bank, and in February 2010 the assets it owned were legally demerged from those owned by RBS. This demerger created two separate organisations, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. The former was merged with ABN AMRO Private Banking, Fortis Bank Nederland, the private bank MeesPierson (formerly owned by the original ABN AMRO and Fortis) and the diamond bank International Diamond & Jewelry Group to create ABN AMRO Group N.V., with the Fortis name being dropped on 1 July 2010. The remaining parts of the original ABN AMRO still owned by The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V., meanwhile, were renamed, sold or closed.The Dutch government has said that ABN AMRO would remain state-owned until at least 2014. On November 20, 2015, the Dutch government publicly re-listed the company through an IPO and sold 20% of the shares to the public.In November 2020, ABN Amro announced it would cut 2800 jobs and sell its head offices as a plan to reduce costs, hoping to save €700 million by 2024.","[{'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 30, 'end': 34}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 102, 'end': 106}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 538, 'end': 542}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1066, 'end': 1070}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1449, 'end': 1453}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1487, 'end': 1491}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1528, 'end': 1532}, {'match': 'fund', 'norm': 'fund', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1696, 'end': 1700}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1759, 'end': 1768}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2082, 'end': 2086}, {'match': 'finance', 'norm': 'finance', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2250, 'end': 2257}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2319, 'end': 2323}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2606, 'end': 2610}, {'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2692, 'end': 2696}]",True,bank,"{'bank': 0.5885224938392639, 'regulatory body': 0.13656318187713623, 'policy': 0.05482698976993561, 'guideline': 0.015591618604958057}"
668,668,CVM,"Contactless payment systems are credit cards and debit cards, key fobs, smart cards, or other devices, including smartphones and other mobile devices, that use radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC, e.g. Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Fitbit Pay, or any bank mobile application that supports contactless) for making secure payments. The embedded integrated circuit chip and antenna enable consumers to wave their card, fob, or handheld device over a reader at the point of sale terminal.  Contactless payments are made in close physical proximity, unlike other types of mobile payments which use broad-area cellular or WiFi networks and do not involve close physical proximity.
EMV is a common standard used by major credit card and smartphone companies for use in general commerce. Contactless smart cards that function as  stored-value cards are becoming popular for use as transit system farecards, such as the Oyster card or RioCard.  These can often store non-currency value (such as monthly passes), in additional to fare value purchased with cash or electronic payment.
Tokenisation is a newer concept of encapsulating a card issuers details within a hardware device application such as via Apple Pay app on iPhones.
Some suppliers claim that transactions can be almost twice as fast as a conventional cash, credit, or debit card purchase. Because no signature or PIN verification is typically required, contactless purchases are usually limited to small value sales. Lack of authentication provides a window during which fraudulent purchases can be made while the card owner is unaware of the card's loss.
Major financial institutions and multinational corporations now offer contactless payment systems to customers as contactless credit cards have become widespread in the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany, Canada, Australia, France, the Netherlands, etc., as consumers are likely to spend more money using their cards due to the ease of small transactions. With contactless cards growing in numbers and percentages of adoption, the number of payments by this method had increased significantly since the spending limit was raised. Purchases made by card now surpass those made by cash and account for approximately one-third of all card transactions in countries like the UK. Contactless payments specifically have become increasingly popular, accounting for 4 out of 5 point-of-sale purchases in Australia as of 2019. Card issuers indicate that they will increase the availability of contactless cards to consumers. There are over 58 million contactless-enabled cards and over 147,000 terminals in use in the UK alone, VISA estimated that there would be 300 million contactless cards issued in the US by the end of 2020, up from the predicted 100 million at the end of 2019.

669,669,AFS,"""Aft"", in nautical terminology, is an adjective or adverb meaning towards the stern (rear) of the ship, aircraft or spacecraft, when the frame of reference is within the ship, headed at the fore. For example, ""Able Seaman Smith; lie aft!"" or ""What's happening aft?"".
The corresponding adjective in distinguishing one feature of the vessel from another is ""after"". Its antonym is ""forward"".
The corresponding preposition is ""abaft"". For example, the mizzenmast is abaft the mainmast. Its antonym is ""before"" or, in a more clumsy form, ""forward of"".
The difference between ""aft"" and ""stern"" is that aft is the inside (on board) rearmost part of the vessel, while stern refers to the outside (offboard) rearmost part of the vessel. The stern is opposite the bow, the outside (offboard) of the front of the boat.

671,671,TRANS,"Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression that differs from the sex that they were assigned at birth. Some transgender people who desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as transsexual. Transgender, often shortened as trans, is also an umbrella term; in addition to including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may also include people who are non-binary or genderqueer. Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. The term transgender may be defined very broadly to include cross-dressers. The term transgender does not have a universally accepted definition, including among researchers.Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label their sexual orientation. The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity matches their assigned sex. Accurate statistics on the number of transgender people vary widely, in part due to different definitions of what constitutes being transgender. Some countries, such as Canada, collect census data on transgender people. Transgender occurrence is generally found in less than 1% of the worldwide population, with figures ranging from <0.1% to 0.6%.The degree to which individuals feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine identity has been called transgender congruence. Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and some seek medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy, sex reassignment surgery, or psychotherapy. Not all transgender people desire these treatments, and some cannot undergo them for financial or medical reasons.Many transgender people face discrimination in the workplace and in accessing public accommodations and healthcare.

The first MPCs were designed by Roger Linn, who had designed the successful LM-1 and LinnDrum drum machines in the 1980s. Linn aimed to create an intuitive instrument, with a grid of pads that can be played similarly to a traditional instrument such as a keyboard or drum kit. Rhythms can be built not just from samples of percussion but samples of any recorded sound. 
The MPC had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music. It led to new sampling techniques, with users pushing its technical limits to creative effect. It had a democratizing effect on music production, allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without traditional instruments or recording studios. Its pad interface was adopted by numerous manufacturers and became standard in DJ technology. 
Notable users of the MPC include the American producer DJ Shadow, who used an MPC to create his influential 1996 album Endtroducing; the American producer J Dilla, who disabled its quantize feature to create signature ""off-kilter"" rhythms; and the rapper Kanye West, who used it to compose several of his best-known tracks. MPCs continue to be used in music, even with the advent of digital audio workstations.

The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA. The races must run on tracks graded ""1"" (formerly ""A""), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce.  Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by a car following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes to the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics, and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier. The cars are dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.With the average annual cost of running a team – designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport – being approximately US$247 million, its financial and political battles are widely reported.

It was first defined by the IEEE 802.3ae-2002 standard. Unlike previous Ethernet standards, 10 Gigabit Ethernet defines only full-duplex point-to-point links which are generally connected by network switches; shared-medium CSMA/CD operation has not been carried over from the previous generations Ethernet standards so half-duplex operation and repeater hubs do not exist in 10GbE.The 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard encompasses a number of different physical layer (PHY) standards. A networking device, such as a switch or a network interface controller may have different PHY types through pluggable PHY modules, such as those based on SFP+. Like previous versions of Ethernet, 10GbE can use either copper or fiber cabling.  Maximum distance over copper cable is 100 meters but because of its bandwidth requirements, higher-grade cables are required.The adoption of 10 Gigabit Ethernet has been more gradual than previous revisions of Ethernet: in 2007, one million 10GbE ports were shipped, in 2009 two million ports were shipped, and in 2010 over three million ports were shipped, with an estimated nine million ports in 2011. As of 2012, although the price per gigabit of bandwidth for 10 Gigabit Ethernet was about one-third compared to Gigabit Ethernet, the price per port of 10 Gigabit Ethernet still hindered more widespread adoption.

794,794,FDI,"The economy of India is a middle income developing market economy. It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on a per capita income basis, India ranked 142nd by GDP (nominal) and 128th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive state intervention and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the License Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India. Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%, and from 2013 to 2018, India was the world's fastest growing major economy, surpassing China. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.The long-term growth perspective of the Indian economy remains positive due to its young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings, and investment rates, increasing globalisation in India and integration into the global economy. The economy was slowed in 2017, due to the shocks of ""demonetisation"" in 2016 and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017. Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic private consumption. The country remains the world's sixth-largest consumer market. Apart from private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. In 2020, pandemic had affected trade and India was the world's 14th-largest importer and the 21st-largest exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the Ease of doing business index and 68th on the Global Competitiveness Report. Due to extreme rupee/dollar rate fluctuations India's nominal GDP too fluctuates significantly. With 50 crore (500 million) workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. India has one of the world's highest number of billionaires and extreme income inequality. Because of several exemptions, barely 2% of Indians pay income taxes.During the 2008 global financial crisis, the economy faced a mild slowdown. India undertook stimulus measures (both fiscal and monetary) to boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years, economic growth revived. According to the World Bank, to achieve sustainable economic development, India must focus on public sector reform, infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of land and labour regulations, financial inclusion, spur private investment and exports, education, and public health.In 2020, India's ten largest trading partners were United States, China, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, and Malaysia. In 2019–20, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $74.4 billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the service sector, the computer industry, and the telecom industry. India has free trade agreements with several nations, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage.The service sector makes up 50% of GDP and remains the fastest growing sector, while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector employs a majority of the labor force. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are some of the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation. India is the world's sixth-largest manufacturer, representing 2.6% of global manufacturing output. Nearly 66% of India's population is rural, and contributes about 50% of India's GDP. It has the world's fourth-largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $588,314 billion. India has a high public debt with 86% of GDP, while its fiscal deficit stood at 6.7% of GDP. India's government-owned banks faced mounting bad debt, resulting in low credit growth. Simultaneously, the NBFC sector has been engulfed in a liquidity crisis. India faces moderate unemployment, rising income inequality, and a drop in aggregate demand. India's gross domestic savings rate stood at 31.38 of GDP in FY 2020. In recent years, independent economists and financial institutions have accused the government of manipulating various economic data, especially GDP growth.India is the world's largest manufacturer of generic drugs, and its pharmaceutical sector fulfills over 50% of the global demand for vaccines. The Indian IT industry is a major exporter of IT services with $196 billion in revenue and employs over 4.47 million people. India's chemical industry is extremely diversified and estimated at $178 billion. The tourism industry contributes about 9.2% of India's GDP and employs over 4.2 crore (42 million) people. India ranks second globally in food and agricultural production, while agricultural exports were $35.09 billion. The construction and real estate sector ranks third among the 14 major sectors in terms of direct, indirect, and induced effects in all sectors of the economy. The Indian textiles industry is estimated at $100 billion and contributes 13% of industrial output and 2.3% of India's GDP while employs over 4.5 crore (45 million) people directly. India's telecommunication industry is the world's second largest by the number of mobile phone, smartphone, and internet users. It is the world's 24th-largest oil producer and the third-largest oil consumer. The Indian automobile industry is the world's fifth-largest by production. India has retail market worth $1.17 trillion, which contributes over 10% of India's GDP. It also has one of the world's fastest growing e-commerce markets. India has the world's fourth-largest natural resources, with the mining sector contributing 11% of the country's industrial GDP and 2.5% of total GDP.

795,795,ESRB,"The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games in the United States and Canada. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA, formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA)), in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content, particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings following the releases of Mortal Kombat and Night Trap for home consoles and Doom for home computers. The industry, pressured with potential government oversight of video game ratings from these hearings, established both the IDSA and the ESRB within it to create a voluntary ratings system based on the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system with additional considerations for video game interactivity.
The board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of ""content descriptors"" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. More recently, the ratings also include descriptors for games with online interactivity or in-game monetization. The ratings are determined by a combination of material provided by the game's publisher in both questionnaires and video footage of the game, and a review of this material by a panel of reviewers who assign it a rating. The ratings are designed towards parents so they can make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children. Once a game is rated, the ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences.
The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries for physical releases; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. More recently, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff, allowing online storefronts to filter and restrict titles based on the ESRB. Through the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for online privacy on websites and mobile apps. There have been attempts to pass federal and state laws to force retailers into compliance with the ESRB, but the 2011 Supreme Court case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association ruled that video games are protected speech, and such laws are unconstitutional.
Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the Federal Trade Commission for being the ""strongest"" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other watchdog groups for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 incident that surrounded the organization's handling of ""hidden"", objectionable content in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which could be accessed using a user-created modification.
The ESRB has been accused of having a conflict of interest because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that it does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.","[{'match': 'board', 'norm': 'board', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 894, 'end': 899}, {'match': 'board', 'norm': 'board', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 4579, 'end': 4584}]",True,regulatory body,"{'regulatory body': 0.9807806015014648, 'guideline': 0.9776515364646912, 'bank': 0.9761740565299988, 'policy': 0.9472977519035339}"

802,802,CSR,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a form of international private business self-regulation which aims to contribute to societal goals of a philanthropic, activist, or charitable nature by engaging in or supporting volunteering or ethically oriented practices. While once it was possible to describe CSR as an internal organizational policy or a corporate ethic strategy, that time has passed as various national and international laws have been developed. Various organizations have used their authority to push it beyond individual or even industry-wide initiatives. In contrast, it has been considered a form of corporate self-regulation for some time, over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organizations to mandatory schemes at regional, national, and international levels.
Considered at the organisational level, CSR is generally understood as a strategic initiative that contributes to a brand's reputation. As such, social responsibility initiatives must coherently align with and be integrated into a business model to be successful. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory requirements and engages in ""actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law"".Furthermore, businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes. From a strategic perspective, CSR can contribute to firm profits, particularly if brands voluntarily self-report both the positive and negative outcomes of their endeavors. In part, these benefits accrue by increasing positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others. From an ethical perspective, some businesses will adopt CSR policies and practices because of the ethical beliefs of senior management: for example, the CEO of outdoor-apparel company Patagonia, Inc. argues that harming the environment is ethically objectionable.
Proponents argue that corporations increase long-term profits by operating with a CSR perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from businesses' economic role. A 2000 study compared existing econometric studies of the relationship between social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed empirical analysis and claimed when the study is properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes. Critics questioned the ""lofty"" and sometimes ""unrealistic expectations"" in CSR. or that CSR is merely window-dressing, or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations. In line with this critical perspective, political and sociological institutionalists became interested in CSR in the context of theories of globalization, neoliberalism, and late capitalism.","[{'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2470, 'end': 2479}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2597, 'end': 2606}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 2731, 'end': 2740}]",True,policy,"{'policy': 0.8658990263938904, 'regulatory body': 0.7423676252365112, 'guideline': 0.5848458409309387, 'bank': 0.3717265725135803}"
804,804,ERM,"Black Wednesday (or the 1992 Sterling crisis) occurred on 16 September 1992 when the UK Government was forced to withdraw sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), after a failed attempt to keep its exchange rate above the lower limit required for the ERM participation. At that time, the United Kingdom held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.14 billion, which was revised to £3.3 billion in 2005, following documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (earlier estimates placed losses at a much higher range of £13–27 billion). Trading losses in August and September made up a minority of the losses (estimated at £800 million) and the majority of the loss to the central bank arose from non-realised profits of a potential devaluation. Treasury papers suggested that, had the government maintained $24 billion foreign currency reserves and the pound had fallen by the same amount, the UK might have made a £2.4 billion profit on sterling's devaluation.The crisis damaged the credibility of the second Major ministry in handling of economic matters. The ruling Conservative Party suffered a landslide defeat five years later at the 1997 United Kingdom general election and did not return to power until 2010. The rebounding of the UK economy in the years after Black Wednesday led to a reassessment of the legacy of the crisis, as John Major's government adopted an inflation targeting policy as an alternative to the ERM and set the foundation for a prospering economy in the years prior to the financial crisis of 2007–08, and the British public turned increasingly Eurosceptic.","[{'match': 'bank', 'norm': 'bank', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 788, 'end': 792}, {'match': 'financial', 'norm': 'financial', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1612, 'end': 1621}]",True,bank,"{'bank': 0.7690526247024536, 'regulatory body': 0.7118315696716309, 'policy': 0.6872464418411255, 'guideline': 0.5478230714797974}"

817,817,CESR,"Directive 2014/65/EU, commonly known as MiFID 2 (Markets in financial instruments directive 2), is a legal act of the European Union. Together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 it provides a legal framework for securities markets, investment intermediaries, and trading venues. The directive provides harmonised regulation for investment services of the member states of the European Economic Area — the EU member states plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein; the United Kingdom will continue to implement the directive during the transition period. Its main objectives are to increase competition and investor protection, and level the playing field for market participants in investment services. It repeals Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID 1).
MiFID 1 was a cornerstone of the European Commission's Financial Services Action Plan, whose measures changed how EU financial service markets operate. It is the most significant piece of legislation introduced in the Lamfalussy process designed to accelerate the adoption of legislation based on a four-level approach recommended by the Committee of Wise Men chaired by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy. There are three other ""Lamfalussy Directives"": Directive 2003/71/EC, replaced with Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, the market abuse directive, and Directive 2004/109/EC on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market.
MiFID 1 retained the principles of the EU ""passport"" introduced by Directive 93/22/EEC but introduced the concept of ""maximum harmonization"", which places more emphasis on home state supervision. This is a change from the prior EU financial service legislation, which featured a ""minimum harmonization and mutual recognition"" concept. ""Maximum harmonization"" does not permit states to be ""super equivalent"" or to ""gold-plate"" EU requirements detrimental to a ""level playing field"". Another change was the abolition of the ""concentration rule"" in which member states could require investment firms to route client orders through regulated markets.MiFID 1, implemented through the standard co-decision procedure of the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, set out a detailed framework for the legislation. Twenty articles of this directive specified technical implementation measures (Level 2). These measures were adopted by the European Commission based on technical advice from the Committee of European Securities Regulators and negotiations in the European Securities Committee, with oversight by the European Parliament. Implementation measures in the form of a Commission Directive and Commission Regulation were officially published on 2 September 2006.After its initial implementation, MiFID 1 was intended to be reviewed.

825,825,ETC,"Selena Etc. was a South Texas-based boutique and beauty salon, which was founded and owned by the late American singer, Selena. Selena Etc. finished its building on January 27, 1994, in Corpus Christi, Texas, which was the headquarters building. Selena opened another boutique in San Antonio, Texas, around the same time the headquarters building was complete; both were equipped with in-house beauty salons. She began manufacturing clothing along with designer Martin Gomez with designs and styles of Latin American texture and exotic clothing styles which became her trademark on stage. Hispanic Business magazine reported that the singer earned over $5 million from these boutiques. Among the employees there was the president of her fan club, Yolanda Saldívar, who had been promoted to manager of her two boutiques, as well as controlling Selena's business checking accounts. However, she would lose this position after several employees began to approach Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, and they informed him that they had overdue payments on their payrolls, so upon initiating an investigation in this regard, Quintanilla was convinced that Saldívar was embezzling money. On March 9, 1995, Abraham, Selena, and her sister Suzette confronted Saldívar and accused her of stealing money from the boutiques and the fan club, firing her immediately, although Selena continued to contact her due to the fact that she had several financial documents in her possession that she needed to have back. Another boutique was planned to open in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1995, but on March 31 of that year, Saldívar would murder Selena by shooting her in the back after asking her to meet at the Days Inn motel in order to return her the financial records and documents she still had. After her death, Chris Pérez, Selena's widower, took over the business. The San Antonio boutique was closed sometime after 1999.After the 16th anniversary of the opening of the Corpus Christi boutique, the store was officially closed as of July 1, 2009. A week after the store closed, Pérez placed a ""for sale sign"" in front of the building. The appraised price of the land and structure was USD$91,454 according to the Nueces County Appraisal District. Perez' asking price for the property was $165,000. The Selena Etc. store had a full-service salon, as well as Selena memorabilia. They also sold jewelry, hats and other accessories. Soon after the foreclosure, due to the low economy, all merchandise and accessories began selling at the ""Selena Museum"", located several miles from where the Selena Etc. building once was.

832,832,RWA,"Courtney Milan, a pseudonym for Heidi Bond, is a bestselling American author of historical and contemporary romance novels. After releasing her first few books under a traditional publishing contract, Milan has self-published more recent works.
Prior to her writing career, Bond was a law clerk for Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court and for Judge Alex Kozinski. As the Me Too movement gained steam, Bond alleged that Kozinski had sexually harassed her. Kozinski soon resigned his lifetime appointment, and Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts ordered a review of how the federal judiciary handled sexual harassment reports.
Milan served on the Board of Directors of the Romance Writers of America (RWA) for four years, spearheading efforts to make the organization more diverse and inclusive. In late 2019, the RWA board voted to suspend Milan for calling another author's book racist. The Board reinstated her days later, noting irregularities with the process. The resulting controversy led to the mass resignation of half of the RWA Board of Directors, the resignation of the RWA executive director, and the cancellation of the 2020 RITA Award program.","[{'match': 'board', 'norm': 'board', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 847, 'end': 852}]",True,Non-Financial Entity,"{'regulatory body': 0.39918866753578186, 'guideline': 0.2516533136367798, 'bank': 0.1814562827348709, 'policy': 0.10536418110132217, 'finance': 0.05514974147081375}"
837,837,ICM,"In poker, the Independent Chip Model (ICM) is a mathematical model used to approximately calculate a player's overall equity in a tournament. The model uses stack sizes alone to determine how often a player will finish in each position (1st, 2nd, etc.). A player's probability of finishing in each position is then multiplied by the prize amount for that position and those numbers are added together to determine the player's overall equity.The ICM is also known as the Malmuth-Harville method. In 1973 David Harville published a method to calculate the probability for a horse to finish 1st, 2nd, etc. in a horse race. In 1987 Mason Malmuth, independent of Harville, used this method to calculate the probability for a tournament player to finish 1st, 2nd, etc.The term ICM is often misunderstood to mean a simulator that helps a player make decisions in a tournament. Such simulators often make use of the Independent Chip Model but are not strictly speaking ICM calculators. A true ICM calculator will have the chip counts of all players, as well as the payout structure of the tournament, as input and each player's equity as output.The ICM can be applied to answer specific questions, such as:
The range of hands that a player can move all in with, considering the action so far and the stack sizes of the other players still in the hand
The range of hands that a player can call another player's all in with, and recommends either calling or moving all in over the top, considering all the stacks still in the hand
When discussing a deal, how much money each player should getThe calculation using the ICM can be elaborated as below:

Every player's chance of finishing 1st is proportional to its chip count
If player i did not finish 1st, given player k finished 1st, player i chance of finishing 2nd is P(Xi,2|Xk,1) = xi/(1-xk）
Following this logic, given m1 finish 1st, m2 finished 2nd, mj-1 finish j-1th, the chance of player i finish jth place is P(Xi,j|Xm1,1, Xm2,x.....Xmj-1,j-1) = xi/(1-xm1-xm2-....-xmj-1)
Sum of the value in each permutation (using enumeration, computation complexity = O(n!))For example:
3 players A,B,C have 50%, 30%, 20% chips, the payout is 1st place 70, 2nd place 30
P(A=1,B=2,C=3) = 0.5*(0.3/(1-0.5))=0.3
P(A=1,C=2,B=3) = 0.5*(0.2/(1-0.5))=0.2
P(B=1,A=2,C=3) = 0.3*(0.5/(1-0.3))=0.2143
P(B=1,A=3,C=2) = 0.3*(0.2/(1-0.3))=0.0857
P(C=1,A=2,B=3) = 0.2*(0.5/(1-0.2))=0.125
P(C=1,A=3,B=2) = 0.2*(0.3/(1-0.2))=0.075
ICM(A) = 70*(0.3+0.2)+30*(0.2143+0.125)=45.18, unit chip value = 45.18/50 = 0.9036
ICM(B) = 70*(0.2143+0.0857)+30*(0.3+0.075)=32.25, unit chip value = 32.25/30 = 1.075
ICM(C) = 70*(0.125+0.075)+30*(0.2+0.0857)=22.57, unit chip value = 22.57/20 = 1.1285
ICM precision
2-players case
For any one of the 2 players the probability to finish 1st is exactly equal to its share of the tournament chips. The ICM gives perfect results.
3-players case
The Finite element method (FEM) can be used to compute for any player its exact probabilities to finish 1st, 2nd etc. and its exact tournament equity. Those exact values allows for an evaluation of the precision of the ICM.
The FEM is used to compute the exact values for all the repartitions of 200 big blinds between 3 players. The table hereafter summarizes the comparison of the approximate ICM values versus the exact FEM values.

The big blind repartition 25-87-88 gives the largest difference between an ICM and a FEM probability (0.0360) and the largest tournament equity difference ($0.36 for tournament payouts $50/$30/$20). The relative difference between an ICM and a FEM tournament equity [(ICM- FEM)/FEM)] is 1.42%
The big blind repartition 25-87-88 gives the largest relative difference between an ICM and a FEM tournament equity (1.43%).
The big blind repartition 198-1-1 gives the largest relative difference between an ICM and a FEM probability (4900%). However that large relative difference has no impact on the tournament equity.
Although the ICM does a poor job when computing the exact probability of a player to finish 1st, 2nd , etc., it gives fairly good tournament equities for the 3-players case.
4-players case
The FEM is used to compute the exact values for all the repartitions of 100 big blinds between 4 players. The table hereafter summarizes the comparison of the approximate ICM values versus the exact FEM values.

The ICM gives fairly good tournament equities for the 4-players case.","[{'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1555, 'end': 1560}]",True,guideline,"{'guideline': 0.8141396641731262, 'policy': 0.7528098821640015, 'bank': 0.7510737776756287, 'regulatory body': 0.6878352165222168}"

848,848,GST,"Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax (or consumption tax) used in India on the supply of goods and services. It is a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based tax: comprehensive because it has subsumed almost all the indirect taxes except a few state taxes. Multi-staged as it is, the GST is imposed at every step in the production process, but is meant to be refunded to all parties in the various stages of production other than the final consumer and as a destination-based tax, it is collected from point of consumption and not point of origin like previous taxes.
Goods and services are divided  into five different  tax slabs for collection of tax: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. However, petroleum products, alcoholic drinks, and electricity are not taxed under GST and instead are taxed separately by the individual state governments, as per the previous tax system. There is a special rate of 0.25% on rough precious and semi-precious stones and 3% on gold.  In addition a cess of 22% or other rates on top of 28% GST applies on few items like aerated drinks, luxury cars and tobacco products. Pre-GST, the statutory tax rate for most goods was about 26.5%, Post-GST, most goods are expected to be in the 18% tax range.
The tax came into effect from 1 July 2017 through the implementation of the One Hundred and First Amendment of the Constitution of India by the Indian government. The GST replaced existing multiple taxes levied by the central and state governments.
The tax rates, rules and regulations are governed by the GST Council which consists of the finance ministers of the central government and all the states. The GST is meant to replace a slew of indirect taxes with a federated tax and is therefore expected to reshape the country's $2.4 trillion economy, but its implementation has received criticism. Positive outcomes of the GST includes the travel time in interstate movement, which dropped by 20%, because of disbanding of interstate check posts.","[{'match': 'finance', 'norm': 'finance', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 1578, 'end': 1585}]",True,regulatory body,"{'regulatory body': 0.7395630478858948, 'policy': 0.5505229830741882, 'guideline': 0.322466641664505, 'bank': 0.3183087110519409}"
850,850,PFI,"The private finance initiative (PFI) was a United Kingdom government procurement policy aimed at creating ""public–private partnerships"" (PPPs) where private firms are contracted to complete and manage public projects.

In 2003, the National Audit Office felt that it provided good value for money overall; according to critics, PFI has been used simply to place a great amount of debt ""off-balance-sheet"". In 2011, the parliamentary Treasury Select Committee recommended:

""PFI should be brought on balance sheet. The Treasury should remove any perverse incentives unrelated to value for money by ensuring that PFI is not used to circumvent departmental budget limits. It should also ask the OBR to include PFI liabilities in future assessments of the fiscal rules"".
In October 2018, the then-chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the UK government would no longer use PFI; however, PFI projects will continue to operate for some time to come. In 2021, Robert Naylor warned that NHS trusts risked sleepwalking into costly disputes with PFI providers as the contracts started expiring.","[{'match': 'finance', 'norm': 'finance', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 12, 'end': 19}, {'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 595, 'end': 600}, {'match': 'money', 'norm': 'money', 'case': 'lower', 'exact': True, 'start': 892, 'end': 897}]",True,policy,"{'policy': 0.6511884927749634, 'regulatory body': 0.5316362380981445, 'guideline': 0.3468240797519684, 'bank': 0.18401089310646057}"

Stimulus data: This is data to be sent to a device or electronic circuit
Expected response: This is the data the device or circuit is expected to send back if there is no error
Mask data: Defines which bits in the expected response are valid; other bits of the device's response are unknown and must be ignored when comparing the expected response and the data returned from the circuit
Additional information on how to send the data (e.g. maximum clock frequency)The SVF standard was jointly developed by companies Texas Instruments and Teradyne.  Control over the format has been handed off to boundary-scan solution provider ASSET InterTech. The most recent revision is Revision E.
SVF files are used to transfer boundary scan data between tools. As an example a VHDL compiler may create an SVF file that is read by a tool for programming CPLDs.
The SVF file is defined as an ASCII file that consists of a set of SVF statements. The maximum number of characters allowed on a line is 256, although one SVF statement can span more than one line. Each statement consists of a command and associated parameters. Each SVF statement is terminated by a semicolon. SVF is not case sensitive. Comments can be inserted into a SVF file after an exclamation point ‘!’ or a pair of slashes ‘//’. Either ‘//’ or ‘!’ will comment out the remainder of the line.
